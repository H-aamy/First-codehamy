         <h1>The art of reading</h1>
         <p>
            
            Reading is an age-long practice that isn't fading away any time soon. You might be wondering how reading can be someone's interest especially if you've always seen it as tedious or boring or always done 
            it as a chore, perhaps to pass an exam. Maybe you want to improve on your reading habits or are just curious as to how i'll describe reading that'll make it attractive. 
            Well, one of the reasons i'd pick reading over anything else is because of the way it transports me to places i hithertho might never go to, and how i get to experience (you might call it second-hand) 
            new cultures, have 'new friends' and even solve crimes. I dare say i know about (more than) ten ways to kill a person without leaving a trace because of books i've read, same way i've found it easy 
            to grasp the meanings of 'jokes' i've never heard before or easily understand a person's thought pattern.
            Reading refines your way of thought, it expands your mind to see the world from different people's perspectives and this makes you someone with depth. It also increases your vocabulary, you might not
            use it in your everyday speech but it sure helps to easily follow conversations without constantly checking your dictionary. 
            If you read through to this point, bravo! I'd add a link to a website where i sometimes download my books from. They have a vast library.
            <a href="http://www.oceanofpdf.com" target="_blank">You'd most likely find whatever book you're looking for here.</a>
